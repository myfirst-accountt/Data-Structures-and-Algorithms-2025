My school projects for DSA 2025.
This is my first time trying GitHub. I have no clue how this works, I'm trying to navigate without any tutorials. I don't even know what Git means or what a pull request is.

But I was thinking more like it's just a storage with a file directory system. Now I'm realizing instead of multiple different projects in one repository, it's more like one repository equals one project. Not sure though, that's just my interpretation. I'll learn along the way.
